# variables    (In programming, a variable can be used to store different types of data, such as numbers, text, or more complex structures, and the value it holds can change throughout the program.)
* (In programming, a variable is given a name, and it can hold a value that can be changed later in the program.)

(x = 5  # 'x' is a variable holding the value 5
x = x + 1  # The value of 'x' changes to 6
print(x)  # This will print 6
In this example, x is a variable, and its value changes from 5 to 6.)

(In Python, you can initialize multiple variables on one line by separating them with commas and assigning values in a similar manner.
